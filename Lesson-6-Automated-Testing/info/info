Code Coverage:

Both Clover & Cobertura supports only runtime instrumentation, whereas JaCoCo supports both compile time and runtime instrumentation.
- Run time instrumentation: you can get coverage report only until the point JVM is running. Once it’s restarted and if you run additional tests,
  you will be able to get only new coverage report and not the cumulative report of the tests that were conducted before the restart.
  In large enterprises there would be unit tests, functional tests, regression tests, smoke tests…. each would be owned by different teams.
- If I want to get a cumulative code coverage report, compile time instrumentation is the easier way to achieve it.

Shift-Left Operations

https://www.bmc.com/blogs/what-is-shift-left-shift-left-testing-explained/#:~:text=Shift%20Left%20is%20a%20practice,in%20the%20software%20development%20process.
- Shift Left is a practice intended to find and prevent defects early in the software delivery process. The idea is to improve quality by moving
  tasks to the left as early in the lifecycle as possible. Shift Left testing means testing earlier in the software development process.
- In the traditional software development model, requirements are kept on the left side of the plan, and the delivery and testing requirements on the right.
  The problem is that these practices can’t handle changing expectations and requirements, resulting in negative outcomes for the business such as:
  - Increased costs
  - Increased time to market
  - Unexpected errors
  - Cost alone is a very strong incentive for shifting your testing to the left. Estimates indicate that over half of all software defects could be identified
    during the requirements phase, with less than 10% emerging during the development phase of the lifecycle. The cost of resolving these defects works in reverse:
